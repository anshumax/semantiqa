// Comprehensive tests for canvas persistence functionality
// Run with: npm test

/*
These tests validate:
1. Canvas state save/load operations
2. JSON schema validation
3. Restoration accuracy
4. Edge cases like missing data or corrupted state
5. Data type conversions between TypeScript and SQLite
6. Transaction handling for complex operations
7. Error handling and recovery

To implement with your testing framework:
- Replace vitest imports with your testing library
- Update mock implementations
- Add to your test runner configuration
