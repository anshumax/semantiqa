# Semantiqa Documentation Update Summary (v2.0)

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document major vision, roadmap, and UI design updates to align with three core pillars.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Vision Document (`semantiqa-vision.md`)

**Version:** v1.1 → v1.2

**Key Additions:**
- ✅ Added cross-source semantic relationships as a core outcome (#3)
- ✅ Added federated queries across multiple sources (#4)
- ✅ Added saved reports and dashboards (#5)

### 2. Renumbered Roadmap (`semantiqa-roadmap.md`)

**Version:** v1.4 → v2.0

**Major Changes:**

#### Numbering System
- Old: Sequential (T-001, T-002, ... T-037)
- New: Phase-based (T-00-01, T-01-01, ... T-12-04)
- **Benefit:** Phases can expand without renumbering other phases

#### New Phases Added

**Phase 7 — Cross-Source Semantic Relationships (NEW)**
- T-07-01: Semantic relationship schema & repository
- T-07-02: Relationship auto-detection service
- T-07-03: Relationships UI (list & graph view)
- T-07-04: Relationship editor (add/edit/delete)
- T-07-05: Relationship validation

**Phase 8 — Federated Query & Execution (NEW)**
- T-08-01: Query planner (cross-source)
- T-08-02: Retrieval (RAG) for schema context (multi-source)
- T-08-03: SQL/pipeline generation (per source)
- T-08-04: AST validation + policy firewall (extended)
- T-08-05: Federated execution engine
- T-08-06: Safe execution with EXPLAIN & caps
- T-08-07: Search & Ask UI (home screen)

**Phase 9 — Reports & Dashboards (NEW)**
- T-09-01: Report persistence
- T-09-02: Report execution & refresh
- T-09-03: Report UI (list & detail)
- T-09-04: Dashboard composition
- T-09-05: Visualization library integration
- T-09-06: Dashboard refresh & live updates

#### Updated Phases
- Phase 0-6: Renumbered with phase prefixes
- Phase 10 (was 8): Graph & Lineage extended with SEMANTIC_LINK edge type
- Phase 11 (was 9): Export enhanced with relationship maps and dashboard PDF
- Phase 12 (was 10): Golden tests expanded with relationship detection accuracy

#### Task Count
- Old: 37 tasks (T-001 to T-037)
- New: 77 tasks (T-00-01 to T-12-04)
- **Added:** 40 new tasks focused on relationships, federated queries, and dashboards

---

### 3. Created UI Design Document (`semantiqa-ui-design.md`)

**Version:** v1.0 (NEW)

**Contents:**

#### Design Principles
- Minimalist aesthetic (thin fonts, pastel colors, minimal borders/shadows)
- Search-first (primary interface is ask/search)
- Progressive disclosure
- Visual clarity
- Keyboard-friendly

#### Design Tokens
- Typography specifications
- Color palette (dark mode with pastel accents)
- Spacing scale
- Component styles

#### Four Main Screens

1. **Search & Ask (Home)**
   - Natural language query input
   - Query plan preview
   - Results grid with export/save
   - Recent queries and saved reports
   - Empty state for first-run

2. **Sources**
   - Source tree with schema browser
   - Status panel (collapsible)
   - Connection health monitoring
   - Crawl management
   - Inspector panel with metadata/profile/relationships

3. **Relationships (NEW)**
   - List view of semantic mappings
   - Graph visualization
   - Auto-suggestions with confidence scores
   - Add/Edit/Delete relationship modal
   - Cross-source dependency tracking

4. **Reports & Dashboards (NEW)**
   - Saved query management
   - Dashboard composition with drag-resize
   - Visualization library integration (charts/tables)
   - Refresh and export functionality
   - Multi-panel layouts

#### Component Patterns
- Status badges
- Button variants
- Card layouts
- Data grids
- Modals

#### Interaction Patterns
- Search/ask input behavior
- Tree navigation
- Query execution flow
- Relationship management workflow

## Alignment with Three Core Pillars

### Pillar 1: Source Management & Discovery
**Coverage:**
- ✅ Vision: Explicitly described in "Three Core Pillars" section
- ✅ Roadmap: Phase 2 (Connections & Metadata), Phase 4 (UI Foundations)
- ✅ UI Design: Sources screen with status panel, schema tree, crawl controls

### Pillar 2: Semantic Relationship Mapping
**Coverage:**
- ✅ Vision: Highlighted as "key differentiator" in outcomes and pillars
- ✅ Roadmap: Dedicated Phase 7 with 5 tasks (auto-detection, UI, editor, validation)
- ✅ UI Design: Complete Relationships screen with list/graph views and suggestions

### Pillar 3: Federated Query & Insights
**Coverage:**
- ✅ Vision: "Federated queries" and "Saved reports & dashboards" as core outcomes
- ✅ Roadmap: Phase 8 (Federated Query), Phase 9 (Reports & Dashboards) - 13 tasks total
- ✅ UI Design: Search & Ask as home screen, Reports & Dashboards screen with visualizations

## Files Modified

1. `semantiqa-vision.md` - Updated to v1.2
2. `semantiqa-roadmap.md` - Completely renumbered to v2.0 with phase-based IDs and integrated progress tracking
3. `semantiqa-ui-design.md` - Created v1.0 (NEW)
4. `semantiqa-progress.md` - Deleted (progress now integrated into roadmap)
5. `docs/update-summary-v2.md` - This summary (NEW)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Review and approve the updated vision/roadmap/UI design
2. Share with stakeholders for feedback
3. Begin implementing Phase 4 tasks (UI Foundations) using the new UI design spec

### Short-term
1. Update contracts (T-00-02) to include Relationship and Report DTOs
2. Implement semantic relationship schema (T-07-01)
3. Build out the four main screens per UI design

### Medium-term
1. Complete Phase 7 (Semantic Relationships)
2. Implement federated query planner (Phase 8)
3. Build reports and dashboards (Phase 9)

---

## Summary

The Semantiqa vision, roadmap, and UI design have been comprehensively updated to explicitly support the three core pillars:

1. **Source Management** - Connect, crawl, and monitor any data source
2. **Semantic Relationships** - Define cross-source field mappings (the key differentiator)
3. **Federated Insights** - Query across sources, save reports, build dashboards

The roadmap has grown from 37 to 77 tasks with a new phase-based numbering system (T-XX-YY) that allows for flexible expansion. A complete UI design specification provides detailed guidance for implementing a clean, minimalist interface that puts search first and progressively discloses complexity.

All documentation is now aligned with the vision of a local-first, read-only semantic data explorer that truly bridges the gap between disparate data sources.
